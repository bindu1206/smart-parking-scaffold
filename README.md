# Smart Parking — User Side (Scaffold)
This scaffold contains a minimal frontend (Vite + React) and backend (Express) to get you started.
- Frontend served by Vite dev server (port 5173)
- Backend is Express (port 5000)
Proxy calls from frontend to backend by using relative paths (e.g., fetch('/api/...')) during development when running both servers on the same host via a proxy or by configuring Vite proxy.

Files are intentionally simple placeholders to let you iterate quickly.
